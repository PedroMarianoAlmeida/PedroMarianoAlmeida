### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

I am ***Pedro Almeida***, a freelancer Front-end Developer.

# Hire me
You can see my portfolio on my [oficial page]([https://pedroprogrammer.vercel.app/](https://pedroprogrammer.vercel.app/)) - or right bellow my coolest repos are tagged ðŸ˜Ž

I am currently available for freelance projects and full-time remote work.

But what I really would like is to migrate to Canada and work there (I live in Brazil) - So if you have some opportunity for me please let me know.

# Tech stack
I usually work with ***Next.js*** and use ***Bootstrap*** for layout and basic components.

In ***React*** library I use functional components complemented with all hooks that I needed (and sometimes I create my own hooks)

I don't deal with back-end, so I always use a third party API to get my data. And when I need to create my own data, I use Firebase to CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) any data.

# Skills

This tools increase considerably my productivity, but it is just tools, my real dev skills are  ***JavaScript***, ***HTML***, and ***CSS***.

And I have the technical and soft skills to work as a programmer since I already work in an office for more than 10 years (the five last as Electrical Engineer). So I handle weel the MS Office Softwares (especially the MS Excel), make reports, meeting with clients and deal with visitors, suppliers, staff, etc.
