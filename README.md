### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

I am ***Pedro Almeida***, a freelancer Front-end Developer.


# Profile

- I am a Frontend Developer by profession, an Electrical Engineer by training (and profession too), a Musician by passion, a Digital marketing manager and businessman as a result of previous gigs, an Investor for financial security, and an Apprentice for life.
- I develop professional and personal freelance front-end projects whilst working as an engineer in my regular job (two years of experience in JavaScript, CSS and HTML and one year of React and Next.Js)
- My main project is a multi-language web app offering the user the option to search for food recipes by their inserted ingredients. I did write the code and I am currently dealing with management issues to transform it into a lucrative business. You can check it out at https://myfridgemeal.com/
- Another relevant project is a freelancer job, a website developed for a Musical Producer. This project has a high score in SEO (indicated for the Google Lighthouse). You can check it out at https://www.caioandrademixing.com/
- In my musical career, I recorded an Album with five authorial songs (in Portuguese, my native language). If interested, you can listen to them here: https://sptfy.com/9r8t
- With my digital marketing skills, I achieved 4k followers on Instagram (in 2015 when I launched the album). I am preparing my second album, which will include another 5 songs, this time directed to a child audience.
